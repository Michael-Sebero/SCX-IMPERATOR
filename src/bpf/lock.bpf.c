 * scx_imperator/lock_bpf.c — Futex lock-holder priority boosting
 *
 * Adapted from LAVD (scx_lavd/lock.bpf.c) by Changwoo Min <changwoo@igalia.com>.
 * Ported to CAKE's packed_info flag model; fexit and tracepoint fallback paths
 * preserved from the original.
 *
 * PURPOSE
 * -------
 * When a task holds a futex (userspace mutex), preempting it causes priority
 * inversion: any task waiting on the lock is blocked until the holder is
 * rescheduled and releases it. On gaming workloads this matters greatly:
 *
 *   - Wine/Proton use futexes extensively for D3D command-list submission.
 *   - Game engines hold vertex-buffer locks across full render frames (T2).
 *   - Audio pipelines hold mixing locks that block the T0 audio callback.
 *
 * Two effects are applied while CAKE_FLAG_LOCK_HOLDER is set:
 *
 *   1. imperator_tick skips the starvation preemption check (lock_bpf.c sets the
 *      flag; imperator_bpf.c reads it).
 *   2. imperator_enqueue advances the virtual timestamp so the lock holder sorts
 *      ahead of same-tier peers, unblocking waiters sooner.
 *
 * TRACING STRATEGY
 * ----------------
 * We use the same two-path approach as LAVD:
 *   - Primary:   SEC("?fexit/...") — low-overhead, attached when available.
 *   - Fallback:  SEC("?tracepoint/syscalls/...") — stable ABI, higher cost
 *                (~130 ns vs ~50 ns for fentry/fexit), used as a backup when
 *                the kernel does not export the target function for BPF fexit.
 *
 * Both paths are optional (SEC("?...")); the scheduler loads and runs
 * correctly even if neither attaches — lock holders just won't receive the
 * priority boost, which is the current CAKE behavior.
 *
 * KNOWN LIMITATIONS (inherited from LAVD)
 * ----------------------------------------
 * - User-level mutex implementations (e.g., glibc pthreads) can elide the
 *   futex_wait/futex_wake syscall when there is no contention, so we only
 *   observe *contended* lock acquisitions.
 * - Spurious futex_wait returns (ret != 0) are correctly ignored.
 * - A task that calls futex_wait repeatedly before futex_wake (spurious
 *   wake-up retries) will set the flag multiple times, which is harmless
 *   since the flag is a single bit.
 * - CAKE_FLAG_LOCK_HOLDER is never explicitly cleared on task death because
 *   the task context itself is freed; there is no stale-flag risk.
 * - FUTEX_CMP_REQUEUE_PI transfers lock ownership to a new task without the
 *   new owner ever calling futex_wait or futex_lock_pi.  Neither the fexit
 *   probes nor the tracepoint fallback cover this implicit grant, so the new
 *   owner's CAKE_FLAG_LOCK_HOLDER is not set until its next explicit
 *   futex_wait or futex_lock_pi call.  This is uncommon (primarily glibc
 *   condition variables with priority ceiling, rare in Wine/Proton) and
 *   represents a missed optimisation for a single-frame window, not a
 *   correctness failure.  A future fexit probe on futex_requeue() on the
 *   WAKING side would close this gap.

/* ── tracepoint fallback path (~130 ns overhead) ─────────────────────────
 *
 * When fexit probes fail to attach (kernel does not export the symbol),
 * the tracepoint path provides equivalent coverage via the stable
 * syscalls ABI.
 *
 * FIX (migration): The previous implementation stored the futex op in a
 * per-CPU scratch array (lock_scratch[smp_processor_id()]) at sys_enter
 * and read it back at sys_exit.  Blocking futex_wait variants put the
 * calling task to sleep inside the kernel; Linux may wake it on a
 * different CPU, so the CPU at sys_exit is not guaranteed to be the same
 * CPU at sys_enter.  The mismatch causes imperator_tp_exit_futex to read
 * whichever op the *new* CPU's scratch last recorded — potentially a
 * WAKE op — and call clear_lock_holder() for a task that just acquired
 * a lock (ret == 0), discarding the priority boost silently.
 *
 * Fix: record the op in imperator_task_ctx.pending_futex_op (per-task storage,
 * carried with the task across migrations) and read it back in the exit
 * handler on whichever CPU the task wakes up on.  The lock_scratch array
 * and its imperator_lock_scratch struct are no longer needed and are removed.
 *
 * FIX (C-2): pending_futex_op is now explicitly initialised to
 * CAKE_FUTEX_OP_UNSET (0xFF) in alloc_task_ctx_cold (imperator_bpf.c).
 * Previously, BPF task-storage zero-initialised new entries, giving
 * pending_futex_op the value 0 == CAKE_FUTEX_WAIT.  The UNSET guard below
 * only returned early when pending_futex_op == 0xFF; with 0 it fell through
 * to the switch-case and called set_lock_holder() for any sys_exit_futex
 * with ret==0 before a sys_enter_futex was observed — a silent false-positive
 * that polluted task priority for up to 4 ticks.  The explicit init eliminates
 * this race window unconditionally.
